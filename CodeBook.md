Code book for the summary of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"
===========================================================

This code book contains information about the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" (version 1.0) and the steps taken to summarise these data into a tidy dataset. Part of the content of this code book was copied from the original code books and README file that came with the data. The dataset and the associated files were created by:

Study design
========

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. These features are described in the next section.


Feature selection and units
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

In summary, the following list of signals was obtained for each window. '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Accelations ('Acc') are given in standard gravity units 'g'. Angular velocities ('Gyro') are given in radians/second.
For each of the signals listed above, the following variables were estimated:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors were obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean


Data structure
=========

The measurements were randomly split up into two datasets, one containing training data and one containing test data. For each of these, the data are split into three files: one file containing the actual measurements ('train/X_train.txt', 'test/X_test.txt') and two files containing respectively the activity ('activity_labels.txt') and test subject ('train/subject_train.txt', 'test/test_subject.txt') corresponding to each record in the measurement data file. In addition, the names of the measured variables were given in another separate file ('features.txt').


Summary steps
==========

We have created an analysis script ('run_analysis.R') to clean and summarise the original data. The output of this script is a new dataset containing, for each activity and each test subject, the average of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of each measured signal. A detailed description can be found in the 'README.md' file. The main steps taken to summarise the data are:
- Merge the activities, test subjects and measurements into one table for the training sample and one for the test sample. Subsequently merge these tables into one dataset.
- Extract only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measured signal.
- Assign descriptive column names and replace the non-descriptive activity labels by the activity names.
- Create a new dataset containing the average of the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measured signal, for each activity and each test subject.
